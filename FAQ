What is Sojod ?
An App to track your daily prostrations during prayer. 

How to use ?
Simply launch the app. Put your iPhone on a stable ground (about 2 inches from where you prostrate during prayers) and the proximity sensor automatically counts how many Sojods or prostrations you have done. 

If Sojod is not working as intended, where to seek support ?
